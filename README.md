Fire will kill us all is an application designed for business owners who wish to know whether their businesses are placing their fire extinguishers in the best place to prevent damages. Through our interface a user will be able to recreate the settings of the room he/she whishes to test. With the given settings, our simulation engine will recreate a high number of scenarios. Our algorithm will then be able to compute the best positioning for the fire extinguishers based on the outcomes obtained in the previous phase. 
Users will be able to recreate their desired room, from the number of people in the room to the materials of the furniture found in the room. The simulation will take into consideration things like human factor (when and if a person reacts to the fire) and flammability of objects when determining the spread of a fire. The final answer given by our algorithm will be modeled after a high enough number of repetitions in order to give a statistically relevant outcome. 
The team wishes to code the back end of the application in C# while creating the user interface and simulation in unity.
