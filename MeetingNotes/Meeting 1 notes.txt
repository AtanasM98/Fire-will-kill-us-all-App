Meeting 1
Time 13:05
Date 12.02.2019
----------------------------------------------
Aim to have a final solution by the end of the week

We come up with requrements, following the minimal requirements

Yosif explains what our ideas for the app are (machine learning algorithm)

Atanas explains we will use Unity and C#

Teacher is impressed with our ideas so far

Teacher explains we need to provide some way to infuence the simulation while it's running

Pick a new place for fire to spawn, spawn faulty extinguisher, provoke someone to extinguish fire.
Pick one of these ideas and implement it.

We should not rely a lot on Unity; only use the animation, nothing else. Most of code should be done by us

In the end of the project we should have some sort of visualisation

Teacher confirms that we understand what we have to do for the project

If we need technical advise in detail, we need very good reason for it

We are allowed to ask for feedback once per iteration

We need to ask specific questions

First half we discuss what we will be doing, second half is the basics/core of the application (the algorithm)

We can show deliverables via Git by tagging them and sending an email to the teacher

Marked assignments need to be handed in BEFORE the deadlines (always Monday, 8am at the latest)

We need to come up with a project leader, who will be communicating with the tutor

This block is Project Plan (by the end of the week), URS doc (next week) and working algorithm

URS expectations
	name of use case and what it does;
	don't worry about MSS
	later with time we would keep adding more and more details to the URS
